# Multi-User Calling Platform

Your app is now a **multi-user calling control center** where each user can buy, manage, and use their own Twilio phone numbers.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Before (Single User)
```
Your App → Static TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER → Make Calls
```

### After (Multi-User Platform)
```
User A → Buys +1-555-0001 → Makes calls from +1-555-0001
User B → Buys +1-555-0002 → Makes calls from +1-555-0002  
User C → Buys +1-555-0003 → Makes calls from +1-555-0003
```

## 🔑 Key Changes

### ✅ Environment Variables
**REMOVED:**
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` (no longer needed)

**REQUIRED:**
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - Your Twilio account
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Your Twilio auth token  
- `TWILIO_APP_SID` - Your TwiML app for routing calls
- `SERVER_URL` - Your API base URL for webhooks

### ✅ Database Schema
New table: `user_phone_numbers`
- Stores each user's purchased phone numbers
- Links numbers to user accounts
- Tracks costs, regions, capabilities
- Manages active/inactive status

### ✅ API Changes
- **Buy Numbers**: Users purchase their own numbers
- **Make Calls**: Uses user's purchased numbers (not static number)
- **Manage Numbers**: List, update, and release user's numbers
- **Security**: Users can only use/manage their own numbers

## 🛒 User Workflow

### 1. User Buys a Number
```bash
POST /api/twilio/buy-number
{
  "areaCode": "415",
  "country": "US"
}
```
**Result**: Number purchased and associated with user's account

### 2. User Makes a Call
```bash
POST /api/twilio/call
{
  "to": "+1234567890",
  "from": "+14155551234"  # Their purchased number
}
```
**Result**: Call made from user's own number

### 3. User Manages Numbers
```bash
GET /api/twilio/my-numbers        # List all numbers
PUT /api/twilio/my-numbers/1      # Update number settings
DELETE /api/twilio/my-numbers/1   # Release number
```

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users
- **Own Numbers**: Each user has their own phone numbers
- **Privacy**: No shared numbers between users
- **Control**: Manage, customize, and release numbers as needed
- **Scalability**: Buy multiple numbers for different purposes

### For Your Business
- **Revenue**: Users pay for their own Twilio costs
- **Scalability**: Support unlimited users without number conflicts
- **Compliance**: Clear ownership and usage tracking
- **Analytics**: Per-user calling statistics and costs

## 🔐 Security Model

### User Isolation
- Users can only see/use their own numbers
- Call logs are user-specific
- Recordings are user-specific
- Number management is user-specific

### Verification Checks
- Verify user owns the "from" number before making calls
- Prevent users from managing numbers they don't own
- Validate user authentication on all endpoints

## 💰 Cost Structure

### Traditional Model (Your Costs)
- You pay for static number: $1/month
- You pay for all user calls: $0.0085/minute
- You pay for all recordings: $0.0025/minute

### New Model (User Pays)
- User pays for their number: $1/month
- User pays for their calls: $0.0085/minute  
- User pays for their recordings: $0.0025/minute
- You only pay for your Twilio account and API usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run Database Migration
```sql
-- See TWILIO_SETUP.md for complete migration
CREATE TABLE user_phone_numbers (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  twilio_sid VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  -- ... additional fields
);
```

### 2. Update Environment
Remove `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` from your `.env` file:
```bash
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890  ❌ Remove this
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. User registers/logs in
2. User buys a number: `POST /api/twilio/buy-number`
3. User makes a call: `POST /api/twilio/call`
4. User views call history: `GET /api/twilio/call-logs`

## 📱 Frontend Integration

### Number Management UI
```javascript
// Get user's numbers
const numbers = await fetch('/api/twilio/my-numbers');

// Buy a new number
await fetch('/api/twilio/buy-number', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ areaCode: '415' })
});

// Make a call with specific number
await fetch('/api/twilio/call', {
  method: 'POST', 
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: '+1234567890',
    from: '+14155551234'  // User's number
  })
});
```

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Call Flow
1. User initiates call → API validates user owns "from" number
2. Twilio receives call → Routes to your TwiML app
3. TwiML app connects call → Records conversation
4. Call completes → Webhook updates database
5. Recording ready → Webhook stores recording info

### Number Management
- Numbers are immediately active after purchase
- Inactive numbers still exist but can't make calls
- Released numbers are removed from Twilio and database
- Failed Twilio releases still remove from database (safety)

### Webhook Security
- All webhooks validate against user's numbers
- Call logs only created for authenticated users
- Recording callbacks verify number ownership

Your app is now a true **multi-user calling platform**! 🎉
