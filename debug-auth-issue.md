# Debugging Auth 404 Issue

## Issue Analysis
The request is going to `/api/register` but should be going to `/api/auth/register`.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. Check Your .env File
Make sure your `.env` file has:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
**NOT:**
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

The `/api` should NOT be in the base URL since your frontend code already adds `/auth/register`.

### 2. Verify Backend Routes Are Mounted
Check that your `server.js` has:
```javascript
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
```

### 3. Test Backend Directly
Test the endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### 4. Check Available Routes
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/endpoints` to see all available routes.

### 5. Frontend Debugging
Add console logging to verify the URL:
```javascript
const url = `${API_BASE_URL}/auth/register`;
console.log('Making request to:', url);
const response = await fetch(url, {
  // ... rest of your code
});
```

## Most Likely Fix
Change your `.env` file to:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This way:
- `${API_BASE_URL}/auth/register` becomes `http://localhost:3000/auth/register` ‚ùå
- Wait, that's still wrong...

Actually, your frontend code should be:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/register`, {
```

Or keep your .env as `http://localhost:3000/api` and change frontend to:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/auth/register`, {
```
